                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Agnes Tiit, and I am currently a student at Tartu Vocational College, pursuing my passion for software development. 
                        Growing up, I was always a creative child with a love for art and designing. While I didn’t take the traditional path in the arts, 
                        I’ve found that software development provides me with an incredible outlet to channel my creativity in exciting and meaningful ways. <br><br>
                        
                        My curiosity about how things work has driven me to explore technology and coding, where I can solve problems and build something from scratch. 
                        I believe challenges are opportunities to grow, and I enjoy learning new skills, whether it’s mastering a programming language, creating 
                        digital art, or tackling a new project. <br><br>
                        
                        When I’m not coding or studying, I immerse myself in creative outlets like digital art or gaming, both of which inspire me to think differently. 
                        My two cats, Sokk and Tillu, also keep me grounded and remind me of the joy in small moments. <br><br>
                        
                        I’m just starting to build my portfolio as a software developer, but I’m eager to learn, grow, and make an impact. My goal is to create software 
                        that not only solves problems but also brings value and creativity into people’s lives. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me!

                    <p>
                        <h3>Digital Art:</h3> Creating digital art with tools like Blender and Krita has become one of my favorite hobbies. 
                        I love designing 3D models and crafting unique illustrations, which not only enhances my artistic skills but also deepens my understanding of design and technology.<br><br>
                        
                        <h3>Gaming:</h3> Video games are more than just entertainment—they’re immersive experiences that spark creativity and inspire critical thinking. 
                        Games like *Baldur’s Gate 3* and *Sun Haven* allow me to strategize, explore, and build while also showcasing the amazing intersection of technology and storytelling.<br><br>
                        
                        <h3>Horror Enthusiast:</h3> I have a passion for horror, especially movies and stories that combine suspense with creative storytelling. 
                        Whether it’s psychological horror like *Hereditary* or creature designs from *The Ritual*, I’m drawn to the mysterious and unknown. 
                        Researching behind-the-scenes creativity in horror films and games inspires me, and I hope to create my own horror game someday.
